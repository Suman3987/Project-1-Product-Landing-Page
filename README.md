# Project-1-Product-Landing-Page
**Welcome to your first project!**

Your first challenge for the next couple of weeks is to build a **product landing page** for any one product you would buy yourself, and recommend to a friend. **There are no limitations to what the product could be.**

Your landing page should give potential customers an idea of:

- What the product is?
- What are the features that make this product better than something generic?
- How much does it cost?
- How they can buy it?
## User Stories

***A [user story](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/) is a description of one or more features of a piece of software.***

### Core Stories

**As a potential customer, I want to:**

- See good quality pictures of the product to help me make a decision about buying it.
- Be given information about the overall product and it’s features.
- Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- Click to navigate to different sections of your webpage
- Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name

**Stretch Goals:**

- Have a button that allows you to add the product to the basket.
- Have a visual indication that something has been added to your basket.
- Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website.
