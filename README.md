# Project-1-Product-Landing-Page
**Welcome to your first project!**

Your first challenge for the next couple of weeks is to build a **product landing page** for any one product you would buy yourself, and recommend to a friend. **There are no limitations to what the product could be.**

Your landing page should give potential customers an idea of:

- What the product is?
- What are the features that make this product better than something generic?
- How much does it cost?
- How they can buy it?
